# Ioto Project Resources

Embedthis developers use a variety of tools and resources to better manage the Ioto project. These include source code control and an issue tracking database.

## GitHub Repository

The [Ioto GitHub repository](https://github.com/embedthis/ioto-doc) is used for Ioto bug issue tracking and support discussions. The repository does not host the source code which is distributed from the [Builder Site](https://admin.embedthis.com).

## Security Alerts

You can subscribe to be notified of important security updates by subscribing to the [Ioto Security Alerts](https://github.com/embedthis/ioto-doc/issues/1) GitHub Issue. Login to GitHub and subscribe under Notifications on the right hand side.</p>

## Bug Issue List

The Ioto open issue and bug list is stored in a [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/embedthis/ioto-doc/issues) site. Use the issue list to report bugs, issues and questions. Make sure you do the following:

* Fully describe any issue &mdash; don't be too brief
* The exact sequence of operations to provoke the issue
* Specify the software version and how you built it
* Describe your system platform: O/S and hardware
* Provide a stand-alone test case that reproduces the issue
* If relevant, upload edited log files and command line trace

It is easy to be too brief in describing issues. To solve quickly, please provide as much detail as you can when describing issues.
