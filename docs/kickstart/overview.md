# Device Management

Ioto includes a sample local device manager called KickStart.

Kickstart is a fully working sample VueJS single-page application that you can use as a starting point for your embedded device management application.

The Kickstart app demonstrates the capabilities and experience provided by an application created with Ioto and VueJS.

## Cloud-Based Device Management

A device with the Kickstart agent can also be managed from the cloud using the Ioto Manager that is created with a device cloud.

The Kickstart sample includes a skin for the Ioto cloud-based Device Manager under the ./cloud directory.

This skin provides a device data schema (Schema.json), display definition (Display.json), logo and custom components (Components.js). These are available in the ./cloud/upload directory for upload to the Builder. Use the Builder Cloud / Edit panel and select "Update Manager UI" and upload each of these assets and save the device cloud configuration. This will recreate the Ioto Manager application.
