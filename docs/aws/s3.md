## API Quick Tour

### Uploading a File

To upload a file, use *awsPutFileTS3*:

```c
status = awsPutFileToS3("us-east-1", "MyBucket", "file.dat", "./file.data");
```

This call will upload the file "./file.data" to the bucket "MyBucket" on S3. The file will be saved in the bucket as "file.dat". The returned status will be a HTTP status code of 200 if successful.


### Uploading a Data Block

To upload a data block to AWS S3, use the *awsPutToS3* API.

```c
char data[1024];
int status = awsPutToS3("us-east-1", "MyBucket", "filename", data, sizeof(data));
```

This will upload the data buffer to the given "filename" in the "MyBucket" on S3. The returned status will be a HTTP status code of 200 if successful.

When executing, this call will block the current fiber, but other fibers continue to run. When complete, the call will return.


## Enabling IAM Keys

To enable generation of temporary IAM keys, set the `keys` property of the `services.cloud` property in the config.json5 configuration file to true.

When defined, Ioto will retrieve from the Ioto service a set of IAM credentials that can be used to sign AWS API requests. These are based on the IAM role `IotoDeviceAccess` in the device cloud.
