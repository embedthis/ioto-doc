NAME
       dbcmd- Ioto database command

SYNOPSIS
       dbcmd [options] --schema schema.json database [model] [field=value]

       Options
           --load data.json
           --reset
           --schema schema.json


DESCRIPTION
       The  dbcmd  utility is a database manager and query utility to interact
       with the Ioto embedded database. It can be used to query and set  data-
       base values and reset or load seed data into the Ioto database.

       The  --schema  option  specifies  the  database schema that defines the
       database entities, fields and data types. This option is required.


       The database file is specified as the first non-option argument. If  no
       other  arguments  are  provided,  the  data  items  of the database are
       printed to stdout as a series of JSON objects.

       If a model argument is provided after the database file, then only data
       items of that model type are printed.

       If a field=value argument is provided, database items that have a field
       with the specified value will be printed.

OPTIONS
       The --load option specifies a JSON file from which to  load  data.  The
       JSON format is an object map of entities with an array of data items.

       For example:

       {
           User: [
               { name: 'Peter', role: 'user' },
               { name: 'Elisha', role: 'admin' },
           ] }

       The --reset command will reset the  database  and  erase  all  existing
       items in the database.
