DESCRIPTION
       Ioto  is  a compact device agent that includes an MQTT client, HTTP web
       server, HTTP client, embedded database,  JSON  parser  and  integration
       with AWS IoT. It can run as a stand-alone as a device agent or the Ioto
       library can be embedded in applications.

       The Ioto web server supports HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, TLS, user  authentica-
       tion, sessions, chunked transfers, file upload, and security limits.

       Ioto  normally  reads  a  set of JSON configuration files. It reads the
       config.json5 file for general  configuration,  the  web.json5  for  web
       server  configuration,  and  shadow.json5  for  persisted device shadow
       state.

       Ioto can trace activities to a file that defaults to 'stdout'. This can
       be modified via the --trace command line option.

       The  --trace  option  specifies  a destination file for trace messages.
       This will override the trace property in the  Ioto  config.json5  file.
       The  trace argument syntax is fileName[:types:sources]. The types are a
       comma separated list of  message  types.  Valid  types  include:  info,
       debug,  error, and trace. Sources are the code module names originating
       the trace messages. You can use "all" for types and  sources  to  match
       all  types/sources.  You can also use "!type" and "!source" to negate a
       type or source.

       Ioto responds to the SIGUSR2 signal and increases the trace level.

OPTIONS
       --account ID
              Override the account property in the device.json5  configuration
              file  when  using  pre-claimed  device provisioning. The account
              property should be set to the user's device manager  account  ID
              obtained  from  the  Account/Settings  page in the manager site.
              --background Run Ioto in the background and detach from the con-
              sole.

       --cloud Token
              Override  the cloudToken property in the device.json5 configura-
              tion file when using pre-claimed device provisioning. The cloud-
              Token property should be set to the Builder cloud claim token.

       --debug
              Enable debug tracing. The -T option is an alias for --tracing.

       --exit event|minutes
              Exit  Ioto  when the given event is triggered or when the speci-
              fied number of minutes have elapsed. Useful when performing lim-
              ited tests.

       --home directory
              Change to the specified directory before running Ioto.

       --id UCI
              Override the id property in the device.json5 configuration file.
              The id property should be set to unique device claim ID for  the
              device.

       --trace file[:types:sources]
              Name  the  Ioto trace file. The types are a comma separated list
              of message types. Valid types include: info, debug,  error,  and
              trace.  Sources  are the code module names originating the trace
              messages. You can use "all" for types and sources to  match  all
              types/sources.  You can also use "!type" and "!source" to negate
              a type or source.

       --product Token
              Override the productToken property in the device.json5  configu-
              ration file when using pre-claimed device provisioning. The pro-
              ductToken property should be set to the Builder product token.

       --profile profile
              Select the operational profile. Defaults to "prod".

       --reset
              Reset Ioto state to factory defaults. This erases database state
              under the ./state directory.

       --test suite
              Run the select test described in the config/test.json5 test con-
              figuration file.

       --timeouts
              Run Ioto in debug mode and disable all timeouts.  This  disables
              request and session timeouts.

       --verbose
              Run with more verbose tracing.

       --version
              Output the product version number.
